# TF2Swapteam
TF2 swapteam plugin that I made many years ago which inspired the ZPS Swapteam plugin.

This plugin allows players to swap teams if they are donators/admins with a cooldown timer.

- Added all the files/configuration items for the plugin. The plugin was made in 2012 back when I was running my own servers for TF2.
